## Overview

Planet is a satellite Earth observation company that provides high-frequecy goespatial data. For satellites in LEO to take high-quality images of the Earth, the satellites must have fine pointing knowledge and control. My project focused on characterizing the uncertainty of the highest precision attitude sensor, the startrackers, sepcifically relating to their performance under thermal loads.

What is a startracker?
