<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

My interests lie at the intersection of theory, hardware, and software, and I want to be a GNC engineer focusing on space systems.

I developed an interest in guidance, navigation, and controls by working on solar sails in my NASA internships. After I graduated from the University of Alabama with a BS in MechE, I developed formation flying tools for a satellite startup. This past summer, led a test campaign to characterize thermal bias on star tracker attitude estimates. Currently, I am a second-year Aero MS student at the University of Colorado in the Astrodynamics & Satellite Navigation focus area.
